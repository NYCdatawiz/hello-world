Learning, practicing, discovering.  

Hi friends!

My name is Emma.  I am fresh off the boat in this new to me data/coding realm.

I've recently discovered writing with **markdown**, which is cool.  Love this [cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)!

I am slowly but steadily learning how to use data analyst tools, starting with the basics in Excel and at the same time working on a Business Analytics Certificate through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). And applying to a data analyst boot camp so that I can dive into this whole new world!

My goal is to gain the knowledge and experience necessary to be able to begin working in HR using analytics to help companies manage their most precious assets, people, and I may at some point start my own business.
